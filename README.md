I have added the source code for the Planner.
To simulate real-world personalization, we created a sample user listening history stored in a CSV file (user_listening_history.csv).For testing purposes, we included two users, one of whom was named after the CEO of Kuku FM as a creative touch â€” to showcase how the system would personalize audio planners for key stakeholders and actual users alike.
And 2 audio files which were generatd, 1 in Hindi and English.
